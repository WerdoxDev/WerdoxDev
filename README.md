## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matin Tat and here is where you can see what I'm working on or what I've done!

## My Projects
My Projects are listed here from the most recent
### Huginn
A very early Chat Application inspired by discord. A lot of work is done on the back-end and API but the front-end is still very early.

The name is from one of Odin's crows which means _"Thoughts"_

The API is open-source and you can check it out here: https://github.com/WerdoxDev/huginn-api.

However the back-end and front-end are very early and closed-source but I will consider open sourcing when It's ready
